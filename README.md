# Problem – Highest and Lowest Pay Rates
### Create a database named Personnel. The database should have a table named Employee, with columns for employee ID, name, position, and hourly pay rate. The employee ID should be the primary key. Insert at least five sample rows of data into the Employee table. The application’s main form should display the Employee table in some kind of List control (ListBox/ListView/GridView/DataGrid).
### The form should have the following controls:
### • A button that, when clicked, displays a message indicating the highest (maximum) pay rate in the table.
### • A button that, when clicked, displays a message indicating the lowest (minimum) pay rate in the table.
